#Project invisible_cloak \
The basic concept is:\
    1) First I am capturing and saving the background frame.\
    \
    2) Detect the colored cloth using color detection algorithm.\
    \
    3) Segment out the particular colored cloth(use color code tochange the color which you want to remove) by generating a mask. \
    
    4) Generates the final augmented output which creates the invisibilty effect of that particular color cloth.\
     every color have different values so change according to the cloth color.\
